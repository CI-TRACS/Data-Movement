### Objectives
Have a basic understanding of Globus and how to move data
Have a basic understanding of Rclone and how to use it
Able to Move Data to a from Mana HPC using Globus and Rclone
Able to Move Google Drive Data to/from Mana HPC with Rclone
Explain how the Globus works and how to initialize an account.

---
### Key Points
- "Globus is useful for transfering data to and from MANA at UH."
-  "Rclone is an open source, multi threaded, command line computer program to manage or migrate content on cloud and other high latency storage. Its capabilities    include sync, transfer, crypt, cache, union, and compress data"
---
### Background

Globus can use several different systems to move data
'Laptop? HPC cluster? Cloud storage? Tape archive? Access them all using just a web browser.

Data stored at a different institution? At a supercomputing facility? All you need is your campus login'
