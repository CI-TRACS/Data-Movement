- Rclone is a free utility for syncing directories between object storage systems (such as Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive etc) and file based storage (e.g. home or scratch))

# Rclone in MANA

Rclone is installed on the Mana Data Transfer Nodes and can be used in the command line via 

~~~
$ rclone
~~~
{: .language-bash}

# Configuring Rclon

Before you can use Rclone, you must configure it 
This configuration step will set up access for the remote object storage system that you want to transfer data to and from
In this tutorial we will configure Google Drive since UH has Google for Education and everyone at UH has it

# Open a Shell Session on MANA
1.) Start a shell session on MANA through your own terminal or you can use Open OnDemand via https://mana.its.hawaii.edu

Clusters -> >_Mana_Shell_Access

From your terminal/shell ssh to one of the Mana DTNs

~~~
$ ssh username@hpc-dtn1.its.hawaii.edu
~~~
{: .language-bash}

*You may be prompted for your password depending on where you are SSHing from and you WILL be prompted for DUO two-factor verification.
