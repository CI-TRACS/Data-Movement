# Data Movement, dissemination and archiving

### Summary
This workshop will be an introduction to understanding the challenges and options in moving scientific data over the network.  In particular, attendees will learn about some of the different network infrastructure and tools available and the use cases to apply them towards and highlight any disadvantages or drawbacks to a particular technology. Lessons will also address what to do if a transfer is experiencing less than expected performance, potential common contributors to a transfer bottleneck and when and who to ask for assistance will also be covered. Different data transfer tools like SFTP, rsync and Globus for moving data will be covered in hands-on exercises. 

### Learning Outcomes 
Demonstrate understanding of advantages and disadvantages of various bulk data transfer tools.
Apply understanding to decide, based on their current computing, storage and network infrastructure and that of their end-point sites, appropriate solutions for a workflow. 
Demonstrate the ability to identify, communicate and mitigate potential bottlenecks in collaboration with campus cyberinfrastructure and network operators.
Demonstrate the ability to evaluate a network path, and to establish realistic performance expectations across that path. 

### CI Tools Used
SFTP, GridFTP, LFTP, rsync, Globus.
